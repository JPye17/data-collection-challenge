# data-collection-challenge
KU Module 11 data-collection-challenge

Background
You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Inspecting the Mars News Site to identify elements. Creating a BeautifulSoup object to extract the text from teh website. 
Created a dictionary to add in lists to review the data. 

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Reviewing the data on teh MArs Temperature Data Site. Created a BeautifulSoup Object and built into a Pandas DataFrame.
Analyzes and built Pandas Functions to review and Analyze the data and built graph to visualize temperature and pressure. 

In this Challenge, reviewed class matieral and used online resources for some code. There were certianly challenging sections that i need assistance on from my peers or outside resources. Working through class material helped build a base to work around and complete the project.
